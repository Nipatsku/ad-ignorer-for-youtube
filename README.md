# Overview

Open-source Chrome extension for ignoring Youtube ads.

Shows a fun little intermission animation that is **not stupidly loud** whenever there's a blocking advertisement.

Also adds some opacity to ads layed over the video, so they are not obstructive anymore.

Available on [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ad-ignore/anddjaemljgpjielbigbmogfpepjhhoc/related?hl=en-GB&authuser=1)
